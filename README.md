# HoriseonSEO

## I refactored the code to meet accessibility standards while still maintaining visual integrity of the page. 

## I removed many div elements and replaced them with the proper semantics such as (section) and (article). I added comments to both CSS and HTML files for quick navigation of the codebase. I gave the site a more appropriate title as well for both accessibility and visual quality. 

## I've attached a link to the deployed application and included a screenshot below.
